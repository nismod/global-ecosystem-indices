# Global Soil Salinity Map

https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c59d0162-a258-4210-af80-777d7929c512

This dataset includes global soil salinity layers for the years 1986, 1992,
2000, 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2016. The maps were generated with a random forest
classifier that was trained using seven soil properties maps, thermal infrared
imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. The validation accuracy
of the resulting maps was in the range of 67â€“70%. The total area of salt
affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear
increasing trend. Further details are provided in a peer-reviewed journal
article (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111260).
