# Soil loss

Verion 1.1 of the JRC/ UniBasel "RUSLE-based Global Soil Erosion Modelling platform (GloSEM)".

Native resolution ca. 250m (at the equator marked with a rectangle).

Shared files are resampled to ca. 25km.
We provide two RUSLE outputs:

- RUSLE Soil loss in 2012 (25km resolution)
- RUSLE Soil loss in 2001 (25km resolution)

In addition, we provide the 25km resolution resampled input datasets:

- R-factor (the original one at 1km can be downloaded from https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/global-rainfall-erosivity
- K-factor
- C-factor
- LS-factor

An example of the high resolution 250m soil loss maps and their ability to
detect anthropogenic disturbances is provided for comparison (location - Amazon
rainforest, headwater of the Madeira River). This example show the "original"
data at 250m modelled in this study. In case researchers/policy makers have
specific requests with high priority or proposals for joint collaborations to
develop new studies with the high resolution data, then please contact Panos
Panagos / Pasquale Borrelli. However, we cannot ensure that we can cover the
requests due to heavy workload.
